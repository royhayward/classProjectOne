            <h2>THE FIRST PERSON SHOOTER(fps)</h2>
            <p>A first person shooter is just that, run around in a first person POV and shoot things.</p>
            <p>On this page I'm going to review a few FPS games for you.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Krunker.IO</h2>
        <p>The first FPS game on my list is quite popular in schools and is called Krunker.IO
            I played this game for about half an hour and I am not the best but im ok this is a game
            that will definetly keep you on your toes because the maps are relatively small wich makes
            for an interesting play experience where you always go around a corner expecting to shoot 
            someone on the othe side and stanting still is the worst thing you can do.

            I love this games simplistic graphics i give it a 8/10
        </p>
        <h2>CONTRACT WARS</h2>
        <p>next up we have Contract Wars i played this game for 30-50 min and for the first half of it
            i couldnt get anything done cause i was distracted by the amazing graphics, UI and visuals
            similar to other FPS games i play standing still is an absolutely horroble idea.

            great graphics good gameplay I give this game a 9.5/10
